      <h1>BASIC RULES OF FUTSAL</h1>
      <ul>

<div className="rules">
<h1>Duration of matches</h1>
<li>Two halves lasting 20 minutes each, with a 15-minute break for half-time.</li>
The clock stops whenever the ball goes out of play or there is a break in play.
The clock only starts again when play resumes.

<h1>Time-outs</h1>

Each team may request a one-minute time-out per half.
Teams may only call a time-out after notifying the timekeeper and when they are in possession of the ball.
If a team decides not to use their time-out in the first half, they cannot carry it over to the second.
There are no time-outs if a match goes to extra time.

<h1>Rolling substitutions</h1>

Each team starts with one goalkeeper and four outfield players on the pitch.
Coaches can make as many substitutions as they wish.
Substitutions can be made without stopping the game.

<h1>Infringements and sanctions</h1>

As in football, fouls are penalised with either a direct or indirect free-kick, or a penalty if the foul is committed inside the penalty area.
Fouls can be sanctioned with red and yellow cards.
If a player is shown a red card, they can only be replaced on the pitch by a substitute after a mandatory two-minute time penalty. If the team concedes a goal during this time, the substitute may come on before the time penalty has elapsed.
