BASIC RULES OF FUTSAL

5 players versus 5 players, one of which will be a Goalkeeper. It is expected that each player will have to take a turn being Goalkeeper. SFUSA coaches will organize this

Subs on the fly, like hockey

No offsides

No goalkeeper punts, ball must stay below head height, otherwise possession and a free kick will be awarded to the opposing team

No slide tackles, players must not go to ground to steal possession back

No Throw-ins from the sidelines. Instead ball is placed on ground and passed in to a teammate with the foot

Free kicks and corners the opposing team has to be minimum of 5 yards away from the ball

With a penalty kick, all players behind the ball except for the penalty kicker
